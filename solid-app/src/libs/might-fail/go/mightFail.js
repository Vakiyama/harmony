/**
 * Wraps a promise in an Either to safely handle both its resolution and rejection. This function
 * takes a Promise of type T and returns a Promise which resolves with an Either tuple. This tuple
 * either contains the resolved value of type T as the first element and undefined as the second if the promise
 * resolves successfully, or undefined as the first element and an Error as the second if the promise is rejected.
 *

 * @template T The type of the result value.
 * @param {Promise<T>} promise - The promise to be wrapped in an Either. This is an asynchronous operation that
 * should resolve with a value of type T or reject with an Error.
 * @return {Promise<Either<T>>} A Promise that resolves with an Either tuple. This Either is [T, undefined] with
 * the first element set to the value resolved by the promise if successful, and [undefined, Error] in case of failure.
 * The error will always be an instance of Error.
 *
 * @example
 * // Example of wrapping an async function that might fail:
 * async function fetchData(url: string): Promise<string> {
 *   const response = await fetch(url);
 *   if (!response.ok) {
 *     throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
 *   }
 *   return response.text();
 * }
 *
 * const [result, error] = await mightFail(fetchData('https://example.com'));
 *
 * if (error) {
 *   console.error('Fetching failed:', error.message);
 *   return;
 * }
 * console.log('Fetched data:', result);
